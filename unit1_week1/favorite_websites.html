		<h2> My Personal Favorite Websites and Why</h2>
		<dir id = "para">
		<p>
			Google <br>
			There is so much you can do on Google. Their main web searching page is very simple in looks, but very complex in what it actually does. The site does pretty much everything right. It is easy to navigate and find what you are looking for. Plus, Google is much more than simply a web searching site, now it does almost everything. Google is amazing.

			Ebay has allowed people for years to buy and sell anything and now-a-days with the Ebay buyer protection, there is no way you can get scammed out of your money. Buying and selling is easy thanks to Ebays usage of Paypal. Ebay is also a great way to see just how much a particular item is worth, because in reality, any item that you can't buy retail anymore is worth what someone is willing to pay for it and buyers determine the market.

			I know Youtube is technically owned by Google, I would consider them two different sites. Youtube is great for watching videos and even expressing yourself in your own videos. Watching tuturials on many different topics, including school, has made life much easier. The site sports the ususal white Google look, but there is nothing plain about it. 

			I love watching videos on youtube because of the "related" videos that it recommends. This makes it easy to find other great videos by users you had never even heard about. It is also fantastic that it is under the google accounts. This makes it super simply to switch between google sites to do what you need to do.
