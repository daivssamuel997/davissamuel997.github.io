				Pairing<br></br>

				Pairing with others was overall an amazing experience. While working with other peers, I find that I have an easier time thinking of what to do and by talking about what is going on with my peer, I feel as though the information is solidifying more efficiently in my mind. The entire experience was fun and rewarding. I got to meet a new friend and learn at the same time. Nothing was difficult or frustrating for me. The entire expience was great.

				Feedback<br></br>

				I felt good when I read my feedback because it gave me some things to work on and improve upon. It gives me more to strive for in order to get absolutely everything out of this experience. The feedback was helpful because I can apply the feedback to my solo work, peer work, and GPS work. I am going to ensure that I listen more closely next time. Listening is a very important skill and I know that improving it will only help me in all aspects of life. <br></br>

				Writing feedback was a little more difficult because I wanted to make sure that what I wrote satisfied the three criteria: Specific, Actionable, and Kind. Finding a balance is key because it gives the peer something to work on while knowing that they did a great job. Overall, through thought and time I was able to write feedback to all of the peers that I worked with. I had a great time with them and I can't wait to work again!
