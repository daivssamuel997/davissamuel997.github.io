			<p>Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.<br></br>

			Commitment is important to me because of my family. My father did a great job instilling on me the idea of always working hard and doing my best. Throughout the years of playing sports, working part time jobs, going to college, doing crossfit, and simply holding relationships has taught me that in order to get ahead in life you must work harder than anyone else. I am so excited for this opportunity to get to go to DBC and I can't wait to meet everyone. I am ready to do whatever it takes to improve. Let's do this!
			</p>

			<p>In general, I try to live up to these values:<br></br>

			Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree<br></br>

			5. I always do my best everyday to improve my skills and be the best that I can be. I am 100% committed and I can't wait to see where DBC takes me. 
			</p>

			<p>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?<br></br>

			The last topic that someone asked for my advice on was relationships. This person had just gotten out of a bad relationship and I just let him know that he is a great guy. He will find the girl that is right for him. This person is going to be so successful and I am so proud of him. I also told him that I will always be there for him.
