			I have a question for you...why Javascript is so popular in Web Development?
		</h1>

		<dir id= "par">

				Well what is Javascript first of all? Javascript is a powerful programming language that can help make HTML files interactive. It is an object-oriented programming language that commonly is used as part of web browsers. Many common applications of Javascript are to allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate, and alter what is being displayed.

			<p>
				Now let me explain why it is so popular today. Javascript is highly interactive and responsive, therefore, making it extremely user friendly. The code files of Javascript help to develop and create HTML files. A feature that makes Javascript so attractive is that it allows for open source content management. This simply means that you can modify code while the website is still up and running. Other features that make it stand out to many web developers would be that it is fast, compatible with many devices today, such as Iphones and Androids, and the fact that it is an object-oriented programming language only helps its cause. Javascript was created with the already famous programming language C in mind and therefore, is easy for people who already have programming backgrounds to understand.
