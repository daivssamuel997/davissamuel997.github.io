		<h1> My favorite websites!!!!</h1>

			My favorite website is "Rotoworld.com". I really love how easy it is to see where you are going. Everything is well directed and the drop-down bars make it easy to choose where you want to go. This site solves the problem of getting up to date news on a player. They did a fantastic job of wireframing the site and practicing.

			My second favorite site is "ign.com". This is a great place to get new video game news. The site does a great job or reviewing games and just talking about news. I think that it is silly how they constantly have so many ads going and even the ad that drops down and blocks your vision. I know that this site could do a better job of making the written reviews a bit more accessible. A lot of times they want to make you watch a review when I simply just want to read it. They must have done a lot of planning though because the site looks great.

			My third favorite site is "youtube". I love watching videos on youtube because of the "related" videos that it recommends. This makes it easy to find other great videos by users you had never even heard about. It is also fantastic that it is under the google accounts. This makes it super simply to switch between google sites to do what you need to do.
